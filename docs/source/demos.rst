Code examples
=============

Every class in inference-tools has an associated demonstration code, which provides a
working example of how that class may be applied in a data analysis context.
All of these examples are listed below, and the sources files can be found in the
`/demos/ <https://github.com/C-bowman/inference_tools/tree/master/demos>`_ directory
within the package root.
