Introduction
------------
This package aims to provide a set of python-based tools for Bayesian data analysis
which are simple to use, allowing them to applied quickly and easily.

This documentation contains full descriptions for all available classes (and their methods),
but does not yet contain detailed code examples of how to use these classes.

For example code, instead see the /demos/ folder which contains a demonstration code for
every available class, including detailed comments.

Requests for features/improvements can be made via the issue tracker. If you have questions
or are interested in getting involved with the development of this package, please contact
me at ``chris.bowman@york.ac.uk``.
