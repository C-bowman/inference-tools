class ParallelTempering:
    """
    A class which enables 'parallel tempering', a sampling algorithm which
    advances multiple Markov-chains in parallel, each with a different
    'temperature', with a probability that the chains will exchange their
    positions during the advancement.

    The 'temperature' concept introduces a transformation to the distribution
    being sampled, such that a chain with temperature 'T' instead samples from
    the provided posterior distribution raised to the power 1/T.

    When T = 1, the original distribution is recovered, but choosing T > 1 has
    the effect of 'compressing' the distribution, such that any two points having
    different probability densities will have the difference between those densities
    reduced as the temperature is increased. This allows chains with higher
    temperatures to take much larger steps, and explore the distribution more
    quickly.

    Parallel tempering exploits this by advancing a collection of markov-chains at
    different temperatures, with at least one chain at T = 1 (i.e. sampling from
    the actual posterior distribution). At regular intervals, pairs of chains are
    selected at random and a metropolis-hastings test is performed to decide if
    the pair exchange their positions.

    The ability for the T = 1 chain to exchange positions with chains of higher
    temperatures allows it to make large jumps to other areas of the distribution
    which it may take a large number of steps to reach otherwise.

    This is particularly useful when sampling from highly-complex distributions
    which may have many separate maxima and/or strong correlations.
